# Clock Adjuster

[Clock Adjuster](https://jamesmikesell.github.io/ClockAdjuster/)  is an app for tuning mechanical time pieces.  Clock Adjuster uses a computer or mobile device's microphone to listen for a clocks ticks and tocks, and then displays their timing graphically.

The graphed times will reveal if the clock is "out of beat", and if the clock is running fast or slow.  Additionally, since a computer or mobile device's internal clock can drift by several seconds per day, a network based (atomic) time source can be used to increase precision.
